# Simple Linear Regression Example

This repository demonstrates the **simplest possible machine learning example**:  
predicting house prices using **Linear Regression**.

## How it works
1. We provide a small dataset:
   - X = number of rooms
   - y = house price (in $1000s)

2. We train a **Linear Regression model** using scikit-learn.

3. The model learns a straight line (`y = mx + c`) that best fits the data.

4. We use the model to predict the price of a new house with 6 rooms.

## Setup and Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
